		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.4

NEW FEATURES
  o added  knn crossentropy and entropy estimators.
      
  o added cover-tree and VR algorithms for KL.divergence and KL.dist.
  
  o	Self-matching:  
  	get.knnx: self-match cover_tree and kd_tree is turned on.
	  get.knn:  self-match is turned off for "VR".
  	In summary self-match is allowed for get.knnx but not for get.knn.
      
  o	knn.reg:  remove "y" from result and rename R_square to R2Pred.
	change class from "KNNReg" to "knnReg" or "knnRegCV" depending to if test is supplied.
	

  o	KNN_ANN.cpp: remove or change variable-size array to "new" ponter to comply with ISO C++.
  o	cover_tree: remove zero padding point dimension.

BUG FIXES

  o	get.knnx: fix dimension for the nn.index and nn.dist ( change  n to m).



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.3

NEW FEATURES

  o 	Index label is added for cover tree
  o	knn.index, get.knn and get.knnx include cover tree algorithm now.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.2
